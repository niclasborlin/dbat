    coordinates (same translation and scaling used by Photoscan, but no
    rotation). The latter reduces the condition number of the design matrix.

  - Now uses PhotoScan default values for control point std and mark
    point std.
  - Now handles object/mark point #0 by shifting all IDs with 1.

  weights (low std) that should be associated with the control point
  image measurements in all images were given to the first points in
  the first image.
