  needed.

Release 0.8.5.0, Jan 03, 2019.
- Major restructuring of the main data structure.
- Added support for prior observations of camera positions.

  rather than by row number.

  smartpoint ids in PM export file.

Release 0.8.0.0, Oct 26, 2018.
- Parameter handling in bundle rewritten to allow parameters to be
  estimated to be block-invariant (common to all images),
  image-variant (unique for each image), and anything inbetween.
  Furthermore, parameter sets can be split-variant, e.g., some IO
  parameters can be block-invariant and some can be image-variant.

  parameters to the result file.

- Bugfixes to generate report file also when bundle fails.
- Added absolute termination criteria - useful when testing on
  synthetic data without errors.
- Added sanity check of input problem based on structural rank
  (Dulmage-Mendelsohn permutations) to detect if any parameter is
  impossible to estimate due to too few observations.

- ps_postproc now runs self-calibration on all parameters that were either 
  part of an "adjusted" camera or marked as optimized.
- Camera reference coordinates, e.g. from geotagged images, are loaded (but
  not processed).

Release 0.6.2.1, Mar 30, 2017.
- Bugfix to handle Photoscan .ply files with no size info.
- Autocalibration now defaults to f, cx, cy, K1-K3, P1-P2 if the camera was
  optimized in Photoscan.

  (cameras) in the .psz projects can have any ids. Previously, the camera ids
  were assumed to be 0, 1, ...

  project had a ray count of 1.

  - Post-processing in fixed camera mode without lens distortion.
  - Post-processing in auto-calibration mode with lens distortion using the
    Photomodeler lens distortion model.
  - Post-processing may be performed in global coordinates or semi-local
    coordinates (same translation and scaling used by Photoscan, but no
    rotation). The latter reduces the condition number of the design matrix.
- Added progressbar to loadpsz for long load times.
- Added logarithmic autoscaling to lens distortion parameter plotting.
- Expanded OP ray count and OP high correlation info in report file.
- Enabled processing in semilocal coordinate system (translate, scale, but

    instances of projections, sensors, etc.
  - Now uses PhotoScan default values for control point std and mark
    point std.
  - Now handles object/mark point #0 by shifting all IDs with 1.
- Fixed a weighting issue for PhotoScan projects. Previously, the high
  weights (low std) that should be associated with the control point
  image measurements in all images were given to the first points in
  the first image.
