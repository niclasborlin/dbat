\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:org59d8c85}
\subsection{Purpose}
\label{sec:org0e78491}
The purpose of the Damped Bundle Adjustment toolbox is to be a
high-level toolbox for photogrammetry in general and bundle adjustment
in particular. It is the hope of the authors that the high-level
nature of the code will inspire algorithm development. The code is
written in Matlab and is verified to work with Matlab version 9.5
(release R2018b). The intention is that at least the computation
routines will be Octave-compatible. This has however not been tested
yet.

\subsection{Contents}
\label{sec:org3f0db5c}
\subsubsection{XML scripts}
\label{sec:orgaf776c2}

As of DBAT version 0.9, DBAT can be used via an XML interface or a
direct Matlab interface. The XML interface allows usage without much
Matlab knowledge, see Section~\ref{sec:xml} and
\citet{Borlin2019:Implementing}.

\subsubsection{Matlab code}
\label{sec:org5de1726}
The toolbox currently includes routines for (Matlab function names in
parentheses):
\begin{itemize}
\item File handling:
\begin{itemize}
\item Reading PhotoModeler-style text export files (\texttt{loadpm}), and 2D/3D
point table exports files (\texttt{loadpm2dtbl} and \texttt{loadpm3dtbl},
respectively).
\item Reading PhotoScan native (.psz) files (\texttt{loadpsz}).
\item Writing PhotoModeler-style text result files
(\texttt{bundle\_result\_file}).
\end{itemize}
\item Post-processing:
\begin{itemize}
\item Post-processing of PhotoScan projects (\texttt{ps\_postproc}). Includes
object point filtering on low ray count and low intersection
angles. For self-calibration post-processing, see the help text
for \texttt{ps\_postproc}.
\item As of version 0.7.0.0, DBAT supports both lens distortion models
used by Photomodeler and Photoscan.
\end{itemize}
\item Photogrammetric calculations, including:
\begin{itemize}
\item Spatial resection (\texttt{resect}).
\item Forward intersection (\texttt{forwintersect}).
\item Absolute orientation (\texttt{rigidbody}).
\item Relative orientation based on the Nistér 5-point algorithm
\citep{Stewenius2006:Recent} will be added in the future.
\end{itemize}
\item Bundle adjustment proper (\texttt{bundle}):
\begin{itemize}
\item With or without self-calibration.
\item Works with fixed or weighted prior observations, e.g., control
points.
\item Works with prior observations of camera positions.
\item Supports check points.
\item What parameters that should be estimated are selectable at the
parameter level, e.g. down to the coordinate level for 3D points.
\item Estimated parameters can be block-invariant (the same for a whole
block), image-variant (individual for each image), or anything
inbetween. Parameter sets may be split-variant, e.g., with some IO
parameters block-invariant and some IO parameters image-variant
\citep{Borlin2019:Flexible}.
\item \sloppy Uses either Classical Gauss-Markov, Gauss-Newton-Armijo,
Levenberg-Marquardt, or Levenberg-Marquardt-Powell damping schemes
\citep{Borlin2013:Bundle,Borlin2014:Camera,Borlin2016:External}.
\item Posterior covariance calculations (\texttt{bundle\_cov}) from the bundle
result, including correlations and significance levels, point and
image quality statistics.
\end{itemize}
\item Analysis of camera networks, including:
\begin{itemize}
\item Detection of structural rank deficiency (Matlab's \texttt{dmperm},
\texttt{sprank}). Useful as a sanity check on input data. Structural rank
deficiency is typically caused by trying to estimate a parameter
with too few direct observations.
\item Null-space analysis if the normal matrix is singular using
\texttt{spnrank} \citep{Foster2009:Calculating}. This might, e.g., be
caused by insufficient datum specification.
\end{itemize}
\sloppy The result of the analysis, including suggestions for what
parameters may be impossible to estimate are written to the report
file by \texttt{bundle\_result\_file}.
\item Various plotting functions, including:
\begin{itemize}
\item Plot image covered by measurements (\texttt{plotcoverage}).
\item Plot camera network (\texttt{plotnetwork}), either static (as-loaded) or
as an illustration of the bundle iterations.
\item Plot .psz project (\texttt{loadplotpsz}).
\item Plot of the iteration trace of parameters estimated by bundle
(\texttt{plotparams}).
\item Plots of quality statistics from the bundle result
(\texttt{plotimagestats, plotopstats}).
\end{itemize}
\item Demo functions using the above functions. The demo functions are
detailed in Section~\ref{sec:demos}. The available demos are listed
by executing the command \texttt{help dbatdemos}. This manual does not
contain detailed information about how to use each function. More
information may be found by typing \texttt{help <function name>} at the
Matlab prompt, studying the source code of the demo functions, and
reading the source code of each file directly.
\item XML scripts that allow a user to tailor the computation without
writing any Matlab code (\texttt{rundbatscript}), see
Section~\ref{sec:xml} and \citet{Borlin2019:Implementing}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Data}
\label{sec:org89bc19c}
The toolbox contains several datasets, including datasets for the
\citet{Borlin2016:External,Murtiyoso2017:Reprocessing} papers.

\begin{itemize}
\item PhotoModeler export files or PhotoScan projects.
\item Images. To reduce the size of the distribution package, only low
resolution images are included in the package \footnote{No images are included in the StPierre data set.}. The
corresponding high resolution images can be downloaded from
\url{http://people.cs.umu.se/niclas/dbat_images}. Further instructions
are found in \texttt{README.txt} files in the respective image directories.
\end{itemize}

The simplest way to access the data sets is through the XML scripts,
described in Section~\ref{sec:xml}, or through the demos, described in
Section~\ref{sec:demos}.

\subsection{Legal}
\label{sec:orgd051164}

The licence detail are described in the \texttt{LICENSE.txt} file included in
the distribution and in Appendix~\ref{sec:license}. In summary:

\label{sec:install}
\begin{minted}[autogobble,fontsize=\tiny,frame=single,fontsize=\small,frame=none]{text}
# == INSTALLATION ==
#
# You can either install DBAT by downloading the source code or (if
# you use a git client) by cloning the repository.
#
# === Download ===
#
# 1) Download the package file dbat-master.zip (from the main page) or
#    dbat-x.y.z.w.zip/dbat-x.y.z.w.tar.gz (from the releases page) of
#    https://github.com/niclasborlin/dbat/
#
# 2) Unpack the file into a directory, e.g., c:\dbat or ~/dbat.
#
# === Clone ===
#
# At the unix/windows command line, write:
#
#   git clone https://github.com/niclasborlin/dbat.git
#
# to clone the repository into the directory 'dbat'. Use
#
#   git clone https://github.com/niclasborlin/dbat.git <dir-name>
#
# to clone the repository to another directory.
#
# If you use a graphical git client, e.g., tortoisegit
# (https://tortoisegit.org), select Git Clone... and enter
# https://github.com/niclasborlin/dbat.git or
# git@github.com:niclasborlin/dbat.git as the URL.
#
#
# ==== Download high-resolution images ====
#
# To reduce the size of the repository and hence download times, only
# low-resolution images are included in the repository. High-resolution 
# images can be downloaded from http://people.cs.umu.se/niclas/dbat_images/.
# For further details, consult the README.txt files in the respective
# image directories.
#
#
# == TESTING THE INSTALLATION ==
#
# 1) Start Matlab. Inside Matlab, do the following initialization:
# 1.1) cd c:\dbat % (change to where you unpacked the files)
# 1.2) dbatSetup  % will set the necessary paths, etc.
#
# 2) To test the demos, do 'help dbatdemos' or consult the manual.
#
#
# == UPDATING THE INSTALLATION==
#
# === Git ===
#
# If you cloned the archive, updating to the latest release is a
# simple as (replace ~/dbat and c:\dbat with where you cloned the
# repository):
#
#   cd ~/dbat
#   git pull
#
# at the command line. In TortoiseGit, right-click on the folder
# c:\dbat, select Git Sync... followed by Pull.
#
# === Download ===
#
# If you downloaded the code, repeat the download process under
# INSTALLATION. Most of the time it should be ok to unzip the new
# version on top of the old. However, we suggest you unzip the new
# version into a new directory, e.g., dbat-x-y-z-w, where x-y-z-w is
# the version number.

\section{Usage}
\label{sec:orgdb716c6}
\subsection{Demos}
\label{sec:demos}
A summary of the demos is found in Table~\ref{tab:demos}.
\textbf{Hint: You may wish to use the command \texttt{close all} between the demos to close
all windows.}

\subsubsection{Plotting}
\label{sec:loadplotdemo}
The \texttt{loadplotdemo} function load and plots the content of a
PhotoModeler text export file. Two examples are included in the
toolbox: \texttt{Roma} and \texttt{Cam}.

\paragraph{\texttt{Roma}}
\label{sec:orgdbbd562}

\texttt{loadplotdemo('roma')} loads a modified PhotoModeler text export file
of the 60-camera, 26000-point project used
in~\citet{Borlin2013:Bundle}. The camera network, as computed by
PhotoModeler, is plotted with camera 1 aligned to the cardinal axes.
The result should look like Figure~\ref{fig:roma}. The figure is a
standard Matlab 3D figure and may, e.g., be rotated or zoomed using
the camera toolbar.

\paragraph{\texttt{Cam}}
\label{sec:camcaldata}
\texttt{loadplotdemo('cam')} demo loads a modified PhotoModeler text export
file of a 21-camera, 100-point camera calibration project. The camera
network, as computed by PhotoModeler, is plotted and should look like
Figure~\ref{fig:camcalib}. The figure is a standard Matlab 3D figure and
may, e.g., be rotated or zoomed using the camera toolbar.

\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{./ill/ccam.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:camcalib}
The figure generated by the \texttt{loadplotdemo('cam')} demo.}
\end{figure*}

\subsubsection{Camera calibration}
\label{sec:org8e068b6}

The \texttt{camcaldemo} demo loads the camera calibration export file from
Section~\ref{sec:camcaldata} and runs a camera calibration. The
EXIF focal length is used as the initial value. The other values are
set to ``default'' values, e.g., the principal point at the center of
the sensor and all lens distortion parameters equal to zero. The
initial value for the EO parameters are computed by spatial
resection~\citep[Chap.~11.1.3.4]{Haralick1994:Review,McGlone2004:Manual}
using the control points defined for the PhotoModeler calibration
sheet. The initial OP coordinates are subsequently computed by forward
intersection.

The bundle adjustment is run with Gauss-Newton-Armijo damping
\citep{Borlin2013:Bundle}. The result is given in a number of plot
windows and a Photo-modeler-style result text file. The result plots
are of two kinds: Plots that show the evolution of the iterations and
plots that show the quality of the input or output data. The former
plots may be useful to understand how the bundle adjustment works but
also to ``debug'' a difficult network that has convergence
difficulties. The latter plots give information about the quality of
the result and may also provide clues on how to improve a network when
the bundle did converge.

\paragraph{Evolution plots}
\label{sec:org7948fa9}

\begin{figure}[tbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{./ill/ccamx0.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:camx0}
Initial network configuration for the 3D network. Only the EO and OP parameters are illustrated.}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[tbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{./ill/ccamxfinal.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:camxfinal}
Network configuration after convergence, with camera center trace lines. In this example, the variation of the OP coordinates is barely visible.}
\end{figure}

The evolution plots are collected in
figures~\ref{fig:camx0}--\ref{fig:gnatrace}.
Figures~\ref{fig:camx0}--\ref{fig:camxfinal} shows a snapshot of the 3D trace
figure at the beginning and end of the iterations. As default, the
evolution is presented iteration by iteration with intervening presses
of the return key. The figure window is interactive and may be
rotated, zoomed, etc. In this example, it is clear in
Figure~\ref{fig:camxfinal} that one camera station had poorer initial
values than the rest.

\begin{figure}[tbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{./ill/ccamiotrace.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:IOtrace}
Evolution of IO parameters during the iteration sequence.}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[tbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{./ill/ccameotrace.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:EOtrace}
Evolution of EO parameters during the iteration sequence.}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[tbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{./ill/ccamoptrace.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:OPtrace}
Evolution of OP parameters during the iteration sequence.}
\end{figure}

Figures~\ref{fig:IOtrace}--\ref{fig:OPtrace} contain three plots showing the
evolution of the internal orientation (IO), external orientation (EO),
and object point (OP), respectively, during the iterations. The IO
plot is split into a focal/principal point panel and a radial and
tangential distortion panel, where the radial distortion parameters
are scaled to provide more information. The EO plot contains a camera
center panel and an \(\omega\)-\(\phi\)-\(\kappa\) Euler angle panel. The EO and
OP plots are interactive. Lines in the plots or legends may be
selected and all corresponding lines will be highlighted. In the top
panel of Figure~\ref{fig:EOtrace}, the motion of one camera stands out.
Clicking that line reveals that it belongs to camera station~21,
which can be further investigated to decide if it should be excluded
from the calibration.

\caption{\label{fig:gnatrace}
Residual evolution and damping behaviour during the iterations.}
\end{figure}

The final evolution plot, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:gnatrace},
illustrates the evolution of the norm of the total residual and the
damping behaviour, if any, during the bundle iterations. In this
example, the Gauss-Newton-Armijo linesearch damping is active during
the first two iterations. For further details on the damping,
see~\citet{Borlin2013:Bundle}.

\paragraph{Quality plots}
\label{sec:org19bf405}

\begin{figure}[tbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{./ill/ccamcoverage.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:ccamCoverage}
Plots of input/output statistics: Image coverage.}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[tbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{./ill/ccamimstats.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:ccamImstats}
Plots of input/output statistics: Image statistics.}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[tbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{./ill/ccamopstats.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:ccamOPstats}
Plots of input/output statistics: Object point statistics.}
\end{figure}

The quality plots are gathered in
figures~\ref{fig:ccamCoverage}--\ref{fig:ccamOPstats}. Per-image quality
statistics is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ccamImstats}. The statistics
presented for each image are the image coverage (rectangular coverage,
convex hull coverage, and radial coverage); the number of measured
points; the average (RMS) point residual; and the standard deviations
for the EO parameters for the camera stations. In this example, the
data does not give any obvious support to exclude the suspected
image~21 from the calibration.

The image coverage is detailed in a separate
Figure~\ref{fig:ccamCoverage}. The plotted data is selectable. All
observations from a specific image, including their convex hull, will
be highlighted when a point or line is selected.

Finally, the per-OP quality statistics in Figure~\ref{fig:ccamOPstats}
show the number of observations per OP; the maximum ray intersection
angle; the average (RMS) point residual; and the OP coordinate
standard deviation. The presentation may be zoomed to show only a
subset of the OPs by activating the ``zoom'' function of the figure
window.

\paragraph{Result file}
\label{sec:org744b85d}

The result file is modelled after the PhotoModeler result file. The
result file of a successful run is listed in
Appendix~\ref{sec:resultFile}.

\subsubsection{Lens distortion models}
\label{sec:orgf464ab6}

The \texttt{camcaldemo\_allmodels} demo calibrates the camera using
each of the available lens distortion models. A result file is
generate for each model.

\subsubsection{Bundle adjustment}
\label{sec:org224d4a8}

\paragraph{\texttt{Roma}}
\label{sec:orged9028f}
\sloppy The \texttt{romabundledemo} function loads the project from
Section~\ref{sec:loadplotdemo} and present essentially the same plots and
the \texttt{camcaldemo}. This demo uses the PhotoModeler file as input
to the bundle adjustment that runs a few iterations until convergence.
The same result file and result plots as \texttt{camcaldemo} are
essentially generated. Since the project is larger (60 cams/26~000
points) than the previous example (20 cams/100 points), the
computation will take a bit longer. Computation time was around one
minute running on a HP compaq dc7800 with an Intel Core2 Quad CPU
Q9300 @ 2.50GHz under 64-bit Ubuntu 12.04 (kernel 3.5.0-45). Two
variants with self-calibration (\texttt{romabundledemo\_selfcal}) and
image-variant self-calibration (\texttt{romabundledemo\_imagevariant})
are also included. In the latter, the principal point is image-variant
whereas the other IO parameters are block-invariant.

\paragraph{\texttt{Prague'16}}
\label{sec:org740a664}
The \texttt{prague2016\_pm} function displays six projects that
compare the result of the bundle adjustment procedure in DBAT and the
results of PhotoModeler \citep{Borlin2016:External}. Similarily, the
\texttt{prague2016\_ps} function displays the results of a comparison
between DBAT and PhotoScan.

The v0.5.1.6 release includes a fix to a bug the distributed the image
observation weights incorrectly. The result is slightly different
estimation results than in \citet{Borlin2016:External}. However, the
conclusions remain valid.

\paragraph{\texttt{Hamburg'17}}
\label{sec:org06f15c3}
The \texttt{stpierrebundledemo\_ps} function runs a self-calibration
bundle on a Photoscan project included in the StPierre data set.

\paragraph{\texttt{Prior camera observations}}
\label{sec:orgb80f727}
The \texttt{sxb\_prior\_eo} demo shows how to include prior
observations of the camera positions in the bundle.

\subsubsection{Error detection}
\label{sec:orga6db3d1}

Three demos are included to illustrate the error detection
capabilities of \texttt{sprank} (\texttt{dmperm}) and
\texttt{spnrank}. All are modelled from \texttt{camcaldemo}.

\paragraph{Missing observations}
\label{sec:org5f7811e}

The \texttt{camcaldemo\_missing\_obs} demo contains a data file where the image
observations of two object points (id 13 and 60, respectively) have
been deleted. With no observations of either point, the rank
deficiency detected by \texttt{sprank} is six. In the generated result file
(Section~\ref{sec:missingObsResultFile}), the X/Y/Z coordinates
of both points number 12 and 59 (with id 13 and 60, respectively) are
indeed listed as suspicious.

\paragraph{Single-ray observations}
\label{sec:orgcb1e8a2}

The \texttt{camcaldemo\_1ray} demo contains a data file that contains
only one observation of object point with id 88. Since two
observations (one 2D point) is present but three parameter (one 3D
point) is to be estimated, the rank deficiency is one, the rank
deficiency detected by \texttt{sprank} is one. The generated result
file (Section~\ref{sec:singleRayResultFile}) lists one coordinate of
point 87 (with id 88) as suspicious.

\paragraph{Missing datum}
\label{sec:org3dd94bc}

The \texttt{camcaldemo\_no\_datum} demo contains a demo where no datum
has been specified. As in the previous problems, the result is a
numerical problem with a singular (rank deficient) normal matrix.
However, in this case the problem is manifested by that many or all
parameters are linearly dependent of each other. This will not be
detected by \texttt{sprank}. In such a case, the null-space of the
normal matrix will carry information about what parameters are
linearly dependent, i.e. what parameters are part of the problem.
However, when the normal matrix is large, computing the null-space of
the normal matrix in the conventional way using the Matlab function
\texttt{null} will be intractable. Instead, the \texttt{spnrank}
\citep{Foster2009:Calculating} function is used to estimate the rank
deficiency of the normal matrix, i.e. the dimension of the null-space.
Given the dimension of the null-space, a basis for the null-space is
found using Matlab's \texttt{eigs} function. For this demo, the
generated result file (Section~\ref{sec:missingDatumResultFile}) lists
many EO parameters as suspicious. The cause of the problem is less
straight-forward to determine from the list. However, the listed rank
deficiency of seven should be a strong hint of a datum problem.

\subsection{Using your own data}
\label{sec:orgb71a8f9}

\subsubsection{Photoscan/Metashape}
\label{sec:orge838b28}

DBAT can read native Photoscan Archive (\texttt{.psz}) files. DBAT
cannot read Photoscan Project (\texttt{.psx}) files. If you have a
\texttt{.psx} project, use the \emph{Save as\ldots{}} menu in Photoscan and
save the project as a Photoscan Archive (\texttt{.psz}). DBAT has been
tested with Photoscan file versions up to v1.4.0, Photoscan program
version v1.4.4 as well as a pre-release v1.5.0 of Metashape.

The \texttt{ps\_postproc} function can be used to post-process a
Photoscan project. \texttt{loadplotpsz} may be useful to visualize the
project, as computed by Photoscan. As of DBAT version 0.8.5.0, prior
observations of the camera positions are acknowledged and used in the
bundle.

\paragraph{Known limitations}
\label{sec:orgef07f11}

DBAT cannot handle all Photoscan coordinate systems. If you get
strange results, you may have to convert to Local Coordinates.
\texttt{loadplotpsz} may be useful for debugging the input.

\subsubsection{PhotoModeler}
\label{sec:orgfec651d}

This section describes how to import you own data using PhotoModeler
text export files. If you have another type of input file, you may be
able to write your own loader. Otherwise, if you have a text file you
wish to import, feel free to mail the file to the the toolbox authors
and request an import function. Althought we cannot guarantee
anything, we may adhere to the request, time permitting.

\paragraph{Export from PhotoModeler}
\label{sec:org7b431aa}

To import a PhotoModeler project into the toolbox, the following steps
are valid in PhotoModeler Scanner 2012:

\begin{itemize}
\item Export the project using the \emph{Export Text File} menu command. If the
command is not available, follow the instructions in
Appendix~\ref{sec:enableTextExport}.
\item After export, open the \emph{Project/Cameras\ldots{}} dialog and select the
camera that was used in your project.
\item Open the generated text file in a text editor.
\begin{itemize}
\item On the 2nd line (usually reading \texttt{0.00005 20}), append the width
and height in pixels of your images, e.g., to \texttt{0.000500 20 5616
    3744}.
\item Inspect the 4th line. For instance, the original data in
\texttt{roma.txt} was (some trailing zeros removed):

\texttt{24.3581 18.1143 12.0 35.96404 24.0 0.00022 -0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0}

The values correspond to the following camera parameters:

\texttt{focal pp\_x pp\_y format\_w format\_h K1 K2 K3 P1 P2}.

Notice that most of the significant digits of K1--K3 were lost in
the text export.
\item Update the parameter values on the 4th line with values from the
camera dialog \emph{for each parameter with a larger number of
significant digits in the dialog}. This usually means all
parameters except \texttt{format\_w}. In the \texttt{roma.txt} test case, the 4th
line was modified to:

\texttt{24.3581 18.1143 12 35.96404 24 2.174e-4 -1.518e-7 0 0 0}.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Loading into Matlab}
\label{sec:org3002222}

\begin{itemize}
\item In Matlab, run steps 1.1-1.2 under \texttt{TESTING THE INSTALLATION} from
Section~\ref{sec:install} if not already done.
\item Call \texttt{loadplotdemo} with the name of your text export file as first
parameter. A figure with your camera network, aligned with the first
camera and rotated to have +Z 'up', should now have been generated.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Using the bundle adjustment of DBAT}
\label{sec:orgbb57d53}

Modify either of the demo functions or the demo XML files to match
what you want to do. The interesting results may either be in the
plots or in the result file.

\subsection{XML scripts}
\label{sec:xml}
The XML scripting language allow the user to use most of the features
of DBAT without writing or modifying any Matlab code. The processing
is controlled via scripts written in the XML language.
\subsubsection{The XML language}
\label{sec:orgdc559f0}
The XML (eXtensible Markup Language) language \footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML}} is a structured,
text-based, markup language. The data components are called \emph{elements}
that contain \emph{content} delineated by \emph{tags}. Elements may have
\emph{attributes} that consist of name-value pairs within the opening tag.
For instance, the element
\begin{minted}[autogobble,fontsize=\tiny,frame=single,fontsize=\small]{xml}
<operation min_rays="2">check_ray_count</operation>
\end{minted}
has the content \texttt{check\_ray\_count}, is surrounded by the tag
\texttt{operation} and has an argument named \texttt{min\_rays} with a value of \texttt{2}.
In DBAT, the argument \texttt{min\_rays} with value \texttt{2} will be passed on to
the operation \texttt{check\_ray\_count}. 

The content of one element may be one or more other elements. Thus,
elements may be grouped recursively. For instance, in
\begin{minted}[autogobble,fontsize=\tiny,frame=single,fontsize=\small]{xml}
<operations>
  <operation>spatial_resection</operation>
  <operation>forward_intersection</operation>
  <operation>bundle_adjustment</operation>
</operations>
\end{minted}
the element \texttt{operations} contain three elements \texttt{operation}, that have
the content \texttt{spatial\_resection}, \texttt{forward\_intersection}, and
\texttt{bundle\_adjustment}, respectively. This is used in DBAT XML files to
organize group similar elements together.

\subsubsection{The DBAT XML file}
\label{sec:org9d069c1}

The DBAT function \texttt{rundbatscript} processes a main XML script. The
script is organized into four major parts: metadata, input,
processing, and output.

\paragraph{XML comments}
\label{sec:org2e3a8e4}
The XML language supports comments on the form
\begin{minted}[autogobble,fontsize=\tiny,frame=single,fontsize=\small]{xml}
<!-- Your comment goes here. -->
\end{minted}
As of Matlab Version: 9.4.0.813654 (R2018a), the Matlab XML parser (or
rather, the Java XML parser used by Matlab), has a bug in the comment
parser. As a workaround, surround comments with the \texttt{<c>} tag instead,
as in
\begin{minted}[autogobble,fontsize=\tiny,frame=single,fontsize=\small]{xml}
<c>
  Your comment goes here.
</c>
\end{minted}
\paragraph{Metadata}
\label{sec:org5b7b894}
The metadata section has the tag \texttt{<meta>}. As the name suggests, it is
intended to be used for project metadata. However, the data is not
processed by DBAT and any data may be stored there. Thus, the metadata
section can be extended with any tag. Since the XML language is
standardized, other software may interact with the DBAT XML files for
e.g. storage or searching.

\begin{minted}[autogobble,fontsize=\tiny,frame=single,fontsize=\small]{xml}
<meta>
  <name>Camcaldemo</name>
  <date>2019-10-23</date>
  <author>Niclas Börlin</author>
  <version>1.0</version>
  <project>DBAT</project>
  <project_unit>m</project_unit>
  <purpose>
    Demonstrate camera calibration using the scripting feature of
    DBAT. See also camcaldemo.m in the demo folder.
  </purpose>
  ...
</meta>
\end{minted}

For more examples of metadata blocks, see the example scripts in
Appendix~\ref{sec:XMLdemoScripts}.
\paragraph{Input}
\label{sec:org043e111}
The input section uses the \texttt{<input>} tag and specifies what data to
use for the processing, including camera specifications, control
information, other prior observations, image lists and image
observations. The camera information, image list and image
observations are mandatory. Some information may be stored in separate
XML or text files. See Section~\ref{sec:fileOrganisation} for a
discussion of path names. For a general discussion on text file
formats, see Section~\ref{sec:textFormat}.

\begin{description}
\item[{Cameras}] The camera section uses the \texttt{<cameras>} tag. The camera
information may be specified directly in the main XML
file, as in
\begin{minted}[autogobble,fontsize=\tiny,frame=single,fontsize=\small]{xml}
<cameras>
  <camera>
    <c>Camera specification goes here</c>
  </camera>
  <camera>
    <c>Another specification goes here</c>
  </camera>
</cameras>
\end{minted}
or in a separate camera file, as in
\begin{minted}[autogobble,fontsize=\tiny,frame=single,fontsize=\small]{xml}
<cameras>
  <file>cameras/camera.xml</file>
</cameras>
\end{minted}
For a list of all camera parameters, consult
Appendix~\ref{sec:camSpec}. For an example of a camera file, see
Appendix~\ref{sec:camFileExample}.
\item[{Control points}] The control point section uses the \texttt{<ctrl\_pts>}
tag. Control points are stored in
''comma-separated'' text files. The parsing of the
text files are controlled via a \texttt{format}
attribute. Furthermore, the control points may be
filtered to remove unused control points or points
used as check points. In the example below, the
control points with id 351 and 410 are removed
from the control point list. For a full list of
the supported format components, see
Appendix~\ref{sec:ctrlFormat}. For an example
control point file, see
Appendix~\ref{sec:ctrlExample}.
\begin{minted}[autogobble,fontsize=\tiny,frame=single,fontsize=\small]{xml}
<ctrl_pts>
  <file format="id,label,x,y,z,sx,sy,sz">
    reference/sxb-control.txt
  </file>
  <filter id="351,410">remove</filter>
</ctrl_pts>
\end{minted}
\item[{Check points}] The check point section uses the \texttt{<check\_pts>} tag
and uses the same format as the control point
section. If any point is used as both control and
check point, an error is signalled. In the example
below, the points excluded as control points above
are used as check points.
\begin{minted}[autogobble,fontsize=\tiny,frame=single,fontsize=\small]{xml}
<check_pts>
  <file format="id,label,x,y,z,sx,sy,sz">
    reference/sxb-control.txt
  </file>
  <filter id="351,410">keep</filter>
</check_pts>
\end{minted}
\item[{Images}] The image list section uses the \texttt{<images>} tag. The
information is stored in a comma-separated text file. The
supported format components are listed in
Appendix~\ref{sec:imageFormat}. For an example image list
file, see Appendix~\ref{sec:imageExample}. In the example
below, any relative path name in the \texttt{images.txt} file is
relative to the DBAT installation directory (see
Section~\ref{sec:fileOrganisation}).
\begin{minted}[autogobble,fontsize=\tiny,frame=single,fontsize=\small]{xml}
<images image_base_dir="$DBAT">
  <file format="id,path">images/images.txt</file>
</images>
\end{minted}
The image files are not needed for DBAT computations.
Thus, a non-present image file will only trigger an error
if the image is needed for plotting of, e.g., image
observations.
\item[{Prior EO observations}] The prior EO observations section uses the
\texttt{<prior\_eo>} tag. The data is stored in a comma-separated text
file. In addition to the camera position, camera angles can be
specified, in which case angle units must be specified. The
supported format components are listed in
Appendix~\ref{sec:eoFormat}. An example EO file is presented in
see Appendix~\ref{sec:eoExample}.
\begin{minted}[autogobble,fontsize=\tiny,frame=single,fontsize=\small]{xml}
<prior_eo>
  <file format="id,x,y,z,omega,phi,kappa" units="degrees">
    prior/initial_eo.txt
  </file>
</prior_eo>
\end{minted}
Prior EO observations may be used as prior observations and/or as
initial values for the bundle.
\item[{Image observations}] The image observations section uses the
\texttt{<image\_pts>} tag. The image observations are stored in
comma-separated text files. Multiple files may be specified, as
in the example below. The standard deviations may be read from
the text files or specified via attributes to the \texttt{file} tag. The
supported format components are listed in
Appendix~\ref{sec:imagePtsFormat}.
\begin{minted}[autogobble,fontsize=\tiny,frame=single,fontsize=\small]{xml}
<image_pts>
  <file format="id,im,x,y" sxy="0.5">
    measurements/markpts.txt
  </file>
  <file format="id,im,x,y" sxy="1.0">
    measurements/smartpts.txt
  </file>
</image_pts>
\end{minted}
\end{description}
\paragraph{Processing}
\label{sec:orga178e73}

The processing section uses a single \texttt{<operations>} tag containing one
or more \texttt{<operation>} tags. The listed operations will be executed in
sequence. The operations are of seven types: Sanity checks, filtering,
set initial values, specify parameters to estimate, set the datum,
pre-bundle computation, and execute the bundle proper.

\begin{description}
\item[{Sanity checks}] The sanity check operations include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Check ray count. Verify that no object point has too few rays. The
minimum number of rays is specified via an attribute, as in
\begin{minted}[autogobble,fontsize=\tiny,frame=single,fontsize=\small]{xml}
<operation min_rays="2">check_ray_count</operation>
\end{minted}
An error will be thrown if an object point has fewer than the
specified number of rays. A control point may have one fewer ray
without triggering an error.
\item Future sanity checks include check ray angles, check object point
projections, check structural rank and check numerical rank.
\end{itemize}
\item[{Filtering}] Future filtering operations include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Filter on ray count. Remove any object points
and associated image observations that have too few rays.
\item Filter on intersection angle. Remove any object points that have
too low intersection angle. For this filtering to be applied,
camera and object point positions must have been estimated.
\end{itemize}
\item[{Specify parameters to estimate}] The \texttt{<set\_bundle\_estimate\_params>}
section specifies what parameters should be estimated by the
bundle. The section is structured into IO, EO, and OP
subsections. Within each subsection, the specifications are
parsed in sequence. In the example below, all EO and OP
parameters are estimated, as are all camera parameters except
skew. See Appendix~\ref{sec:setBundleEstimateParams} for a
complete specification of the section.
\begin{minted}[autogobble,fontsize=\tiny,frame=single,fontsize=\small]{xml}
<set_bundle_estimate_params>
  <io>
    <all>true</all>
    <skew>false</skew>
  </io>
  <eo>true</eo>
  <op>true</op>
</set_bundle_estimate_params>
\end{minted}
\item[{Set initial values}] The \texttt{<set\_initial\_values>} operation specifies
initial values for the bundle. This should be used if the initial
values are not computed by other means, e.g., by spatial
intersection or forward intersection. Often, the initial values
may be set to values loaded in the \texttt{input} section. In the
example below, the IO and OP parameters are set to their
pre-loaded values. No values are specified for the EO parameters,
and they must be estimated by, e.g., spatial intersection. See
Appendix~\ref{sec:setInitialValues} for a complete specification.
\begin{minted}[autogobble,fontsize=\tiny,frame=single,fontsize=\small]{xml}
<set_initial_values>
  <io>loaded</io>
  <op>loaded</op>
</set_initial_values>
\end{minted}
\item[{Set datum}] Usually, the datum is set via control points. For a
control-point-free project, it is possible to set up
the project for dependent relative orientation instead.
In that case, the EO parameters of one camera is fixed
together with a position coordinate of another camera.
In the example below, camera number 1 is used as the
reference camera. The coordinate of the second camera
is set to make the baseline as long as possible. If the
baseline parameter is \texttt{x}, \texttt{y}, or \texttt{z}, the coordinate
selection for the second camera is restricted to that
coordinate.
\begin{minted}[autogobble,fontsize=\tiny,frame=single,fontsize=\small]{xml}
<operation>
  <set_datum ref_cam="1" ref_base="longest">depend</set_datum>
</operation>
\end{minted}
\item[{Pre-bundle computations}] The pre-bundle computations include
\begin{description}
\item[{Spatial resection}] Estimate external orientation parameters by
spatial resection. The operation will fail if IO parameters are
unset or too few control points are visible in some image.
\begin{minted}[autogobble,fontsize=\tiny,frame=single,fontsize=\small]{xml}
<operation>spatial_resection</operation>
\end{minted}
\item[{Forward intersection}] Compute OP coordinates using forward
intersection. Only the object points that are to be estimated
by the bundle are computed. The operation will fail unless the
IO and EO parameters are set and that at least two image points
are present for every object point.
\begin{minted}[autogobble,fontsize=\tiny,frame=single,fontsize=\small]{xml}
<operation>forward_intersection</operation>
\end{minted}
\end{description}
\item[{The bundle proper}] Execute the bundle adjustment procedure. All
parameters must have initial values and the parameters to
estimate must have been set.
\begin{minted}[autogobble,fontsize=\tiny,frame=single,fontsize=\small]{xml}
<operation>bundle_adjustment</operation>
\end{minted}
\end{description}
\paragraph{Output}
\label{sec:orgf998710}
The output section specifies what plots (\texttt{<plots>}) and files
(\texttt{<files>}) should be produced after the completion of the processing.
A complete list of the plots that can be produced is given in
Appendix~\ref{sec:plots}. A list of the output files that can be
generated is presented in Appendix~\ref{sec:outputFiles}.
\paragraph{File organisation}
\label{sec:fileOrganisation}
\sloppy
The \texttt{<input>} and output \texttt{<files>} tags support the attribute
\texttt{base\_dir} that is used to simplify the organisation of files that
belong to the same project. If the \texttt{base\_dir} attribute is specified,
any relative path name \footnote{Path names can be absolute or relative. An absolute
path name starts with a root symbol (backslash \texttt{\textbackslash{}} on Windows, slash
\texttt{/} on other operating systems) or or a drive letter followed by a
colon, e.g. \texttt{C:\textbackslash{}}. A relative path starts with something else.} in the subblock is assumed to
be rooted in \texttt{base\_dir}. For instance, the block
\begin{minted}[autogobble,fontsize=\tiny,frame=single,fontsize=\small]{xml}
<input base_dir="C:/projects/sxb">
  ...
  <ctrl_pts>
    <file format="id,label,x,y,z,sx,sy,sz">
      reference/sxb-control.txt
    </file>
  </ctrl_pts>
  ...
</input>
\end{minted}
will load the control points from the file
\texttt{C:/projects/sxb/reference/sxb-control.txt}. The \texttt{base\_dir} attribute
can be any path. Furthermore, \texttt{base\_dir} can be specified to be
relative to the special directories listed below.

\sloppy
\begin{description}
\item[{\texttt{\$DBAT}}] The root of the DBAT installation, i.e., the directory
that contains the \texttt{README.txt} file.
\item[{\texttt{\$HOME}}] The home directory of the user, as known to Matlab via
the \texttt{user.home} Java property \footnote{The Matlab command is
\texttt{char(java.lang.System.getProperty('user.home'))}.}. This
is typically \texttt{C:\textbackslash{}Users\textbackslash{}username} on Windows,
\texttt{/Users/username} on Mac/OS X, and \texttt{/home/username} on
Linux, where 'username' is the current user name.
\item[{\texttt{\$HERE}}] The directory containing the XML file in use.
\end{description}

\sloppy
Furthermore, the \texttt{images} tag supports another tag \texttt{image\_base\_dir}
that can be used to specify a root directory for the images. For instance,
the block
\begin{minted}[autogobble,fontsize=\tiny,frame=single,fontsize=\small]{xml}
<input base_dir="C:/projects/sxb">
  ...
  <images image_base_dir="Z:/server/project_images/sxb">
    <file format="id,path">images/images.txt</file>
  </images>
  ...
</input>
\end{minted}
specifies that any relative path name loaded from \texttt{images.txt} is
relative to the path \texttt{Z:/server/project\_images/sxb}. Note that the
path \texttt{images/images.txt} is relative to the input \texttt{base\_dir}, i.e.,
the full path name is \texttt{C:/projects/sxb/images/images.txt}.

\paragraph{Text files and format strings}
\label{sec:textFormat}
Several types of data is stored in ''comma-separated'' text files.
DBAT uses format strings to indicate what data is to be read or
written to each file. As default, the text files may include comment
lines starting with the hash (\texttt{\#}) character. The non-comment lines
contain the specified information, separated by commas \footnote{The DBAT back-end supports other separators and comment
characters. This support is not yet implemented in the DBAT front-end
XML parser.}. The
elements of the format are numeric or strings. Please note that any
string cannot contain the separator character, i.e. a comma.

To avoid processing incorrect data, DBAT will require that each data
line conforms to the format. If too few or too many elements are
present on a data line, DBAT will signal an error. To allow some
flexibility of what data to use, the format keyword \texttt{ignored} may be
used to indicate that a data item is present, but should be ignored.
For instance, if the data stored in a control point file corresponds
to the format \texttt{"id,label,x,y,z,sx,sy,sz"}, but the standard deviations
should be ignored, the format string
\texttt{"id,label,x,y,z,ignored,ignored,ignored"} should be used.

\subsubsection{Example scripts}
\label{sec:org8fe4e31}

\sloppy 
The supplied scripts are presented in
Appendix~\ref{sec:XMLdemoScripts}. To run one of the supplied scripts,
call \texttt{rundbatscript} with either of the strings \texttt{camcaldemo},
\texttt{romabundledemo}, or \texttt{sxb} as arguments. If you wish to locate a
script yourself, start \texttt{rundbatscript} without any argument and you
will be asked about the location of the script to run.

\section{Enabling text export from PhotoModeler}
\label{sec:enableTextExport}
Some versions of PhotoModeler do not have the text file export option
enabled by default. In that case, the following steps worked in
PhotoModeler Scanner 2012:

\begin{itemize}
\item Right-click on the main window toolbar, select \emph{Customize
toolbar\ldots{}}.
\item In the \emph{Commands} tab, select the \emph{File} category.
\item Drag the \emph{Export Text File\ldots{}} command to a toolbar of your choice.
\item Now you should be able to export your project as a text file by
clicking on the \emph{Export Text File} button.
\end{itemize}

\section{Rotation model}
\label{sec:org223ff88}

Currently, the only supported rotation model is the omega-phi-kappa
Euler angle rotation model \citep[Ch. 2.1.2.3]{McGlone2004:Manual}.

\subsubsection{Camera specification}
\label{sec:camSpec}
The tags below are used to specify camera information. 
\paragraph{Descriptive parameters}
\label{sec:org2cd6eb2}
The following parameters describe the camera type and projection
model:
\begin{description}
\item[{id}] Integer. The camera number used if multiple cameras are used.
Not currently supported.
\item[{name}] A string describing the camera.
\item[{unit}] A string with the unit used to describe the camera
parameters. Currently, only \texttt{mm} is supported.
\item[{image}] The width and height of the image, in pixels, separated by
a comma.
\item[{sensor}] The sensor width and height, in camera units, separated by
a comma. The special string \texttt{auto} may be used for the
sensor width, in which case the sensor width is computed
to match the \texttt{aspect}. See also \texttt{aspect}.
\item[{focal}] The nominal focal length in camera units.
\item[{nK}] The number of radial lens distortion coefficients. Can also be
specified implicitly via the \texttt{K} tag.
\item[{nP}] The number of tangential lens distortion coefficients. Can
also be specified implicitly via the \texttt{P} tag.
\item[{calibrated}] String \texttt{yes} or \texttt{no}, indicating whether the camera
is calibrated.
\item[{model}] Integer denoting the  projection model to be used by DBAT.

\item[{pp}] The principal point coordinates, separated by a comma. The
special string \texttt{default} will set the principal point to the
center of the image.
\item[{aspect}] The pixel aspect ratio, i.e., width/height. The special
string \texttt{auto} can be used to compute the aspect ratio from
the sensor and image sizes. See also \texttt{sensor}.
\item[{skew}] The skew, i.e., the non-orthogonality of the image axis.
\item[{K}] The radial lens distortion coefficients values, separated by
commas.
\item[{P}] The tangential lens distortion coefficients values, separated

\texttt{sxy} & numeric field with the planimetric standard deviation\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\subsection{Operations}
\label{sec:org2199a6d}
\subsubsection{Specify parameters to estimate}
\label{sec:setBundleEstimateParams}
The \texttt{<set\_bundle\_estimate\_params>} section has \texttt{<io>}, \texttt{<eo>}, and
\texttt{<op>} subsections. Within each subsection, parameter names,
individual or groups, are listed with a \texttt{true} or \texttt{false} string as
content. For the EO and OP parameters, the string \texttt{default} may be
used to indicate that all parameters except parameters with fixed
prior observations, including control points, should be estimated.
The tags within the subsections are parsed and executed in
sequence. Thus, in the example below, all camera parameters are
estimated except skew.
\begin{minted}[autogobble,fontsize=\tiny,frame=single,fontsize=\small]{xml}
<set_bundle_estimate_params>
  <io>
    <all>true</all>
    <skew>false</skew>
  </io>
  <eo>
    <all>true</all>
  </eo>
  <op>
    <all>true</all>
  </op>
</set_bundle_estimate_params>
\end{minted}
If the same string applies to all parameters in a subblock, the block
may be abbreviated. In the example below, none of the IO parameters,
all of the EO parameters, and all non-fixed OP parameters are
estimated.
\begin{minted}[autogobble,fontsize=\tiny,frame=single,fontsize=\small]{xml}
<set_bundle_estimate_params>
  <io>false</io>
  <eo>true</eo>
  <op>default</op>
</set_bundle_estimate_params>
\end{minted}
The table below contains all tags that may be used to specify what
parameters to estimate.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l|l}
IO  parameters & \\
\hline
\texttt{cc} & The camera constant\\
\texttt{pp} & The principal point\\
\texttt{px}, \texttt{py} & The x- and y- components of the principal point\\
\texttt{aspect} & The pixel aspect ratio\\
\texttt{skew} & The image axis off-orthogonal parameter\\
\texttt{K} & All radial lens distortion coefficients\\
\texttt{K1}, \texttt{K2}, \texttt{K3} & Individual radial lens distortion coefficients\\
\texttt{P} & All tangential lens distortion coefficients\\
\texttt{P1}, \texttt{P2} & Individual tangential lens distortion coefficients\\
\texttt{all} & All camera parameters\\
\hline
EO parameters & \\
\hline
\texttt{x}, \texttt{y}, \texttt{z} & Individual coordinates\\
\texttt{pos} & All coordinates\\
\texttt{angles} & All angles\\
\texttt{all} & All external orientation parameters\\
\hline
OP parameters & \\
\hline
\texttt{x}, \texttt{y}, \texttt{z} & Individual coordinates\\
\texttt{all} & All coordinates\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

If parameter \(K_i\) is set to be estimated, so is \(K_1\), \ldots{},
\(K_{i-1}\). Similarly, if parameter \(K_i\) is set to not be estimated,
so is \(K_{i+1}\), \ldots{} The same is true for the \(P\) parameters, except
that \(P_1\) and \(P_2\) are always estimated together.

\subsubsection{Specify initial values}
\label{sec:setInitialValues}
The \texttt{<set\_initial\_values>} section is similarly organized as the
\texttt{<set\_bundle\_estimate\_params>}. Thus, it has \texttt{<io>}, \texttt{<eo>}, and
\texttt{<op>} subsections and the tags within each subsection are parsed and
executed in sequence.

The only content for the EO and OP sections is the string \texttt{loaded},
which means that prior observations loaded by the input section are
used as initial values. The \texttt{loaded} string may also be used for the
IO parameters. Otherwise, IO parameters may be set to specified
constant values or default values. For the principal point, radial,
and tangential distortion coefficients, multiple values (2, \texttt{nK}, and
\texttt{nP}, respectively) should be entered separated by commas. The string
\texttt{focal} can be used for the camera constant to use the nominal focal
length as an initial value. The string \texttt{default} can be used for all
parameters with meanings in the table below:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l|l}
Parameter & Default value\\
\hline
\texttt{cc} & \texttt{focal}\\
\texttt{pp} & The center of the image\\
\texttt{aspect} & 1\\
\texttt{skew} & 0\\
\texttt{K} & List of \texttt{nK} zeros\\
\texttt{P} & List of \texttt{nP} zeros\\
\texttt{all} & All values above\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
