                  rules", a well-designed close-range architectural
                  photogrammetric project should include a sketch of
                  the project site with the approximate position and
                  viewing direction of each image. This orientation
                  metadata is important to determine which part of the
                  object each image covers. In principle, the metadata
                  could be used as initial values for the camera
                  external orientation (EO) parameters. However, this
                  has rarely been used, partly due to convergence
                  problem for the bundle adjustment procedure.  In
                  this paper we present a photogrammetric
                  reconstruction pipeline based on classical methods
                  and investigate if and how the linesearch bundle
                  algorithm of Borlin et al. (2004) and/or metadata
                  can be used to aid the reconstruction process in
                  architectural photogrammetry when the classical
                  methods fail.  The primary initial values for the
                  bundle are calculated by the five-point algorithm by
                  Nist{\'e}r (Stewenius et al., 2006). Should the
                  bundle fail, initial values derived from metadata
                  are calculated and used for a second bundle attempt.
                  The pipeline was evaluated on an image set of the
                  INSA building in Strasbourg. The data set includes
                  mixed convex and non-convex subnetworks and a
                  combination of manual and automatic measurements.
                  The results show that, in general, the classical
                  bundle algorithm with five-point initial values
                  worked well. However, in cases where it did fail,
                  linesearch bundle and/or metadata initial values did
                  help. The presented approach is interesting for
                  solving EO problems when the automatic orientation
                  processes fail as well as to simplify keeping a link
                  between the metadata containing the plan of how the
                  project should have become and the actual
                  reconstructed network as it turned out to be.},

                  the first solution which was published in 1841 by a
                  German mathematician, continuing through the
                  solutions published in the German and then American

                  stability of these three point perspective solutions
                  are also discussed. We show that even in case where
                  the solution is not near the geometric unstable
                  region, considerable care must be exercised in the

                  five-point relative pose problem, IEEE Transactions
                  on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 26
                  (6), 756--770]. The name of the algorithm arises
                  from the fact that it can operate even on the
                  minimal five-point correspondences required for a
                  finite number of solutions to relative
                  orientation. For the minimal five correspondences,
                  the algorithm returns up to 10 real solutions. The
                  algorithm can also operate on many points. Like the
                  previous version of the five-point algorithm, our
                  method can operate correctly even in the face of
                  critical surfaces, including planar and ruled
                  quadric scenes. The paper presents comparisons with
                  other direct methods, including the previously
                  developed five-point method, two different six-point
                  methods, the seven-point method, and the eight-point
                  method. It is shown that the five-point method is
                  superior in most cases among the direct methods. The
                  new version of the algorithm was developed from the
                  perspective of algebraic geometry and is presented
                  in the context of computing a Gr{\"o}bner basis. The
                  constraints are formulated in terms of polynomial
                  equations in the entries of the fundamental
                  matrix. The polynomial equations generate an
                  algebraic ideal for which a Gr{\"o}bner basis is
                  computed. The Gr{\"o}bner basis is used to compute
                  the action matrix for multiplication by a single
                  variable monomial. The eigenvectors of the action
                  matrix give the solutions for all the variables and
                  thereby also relative orientation. Using a
                  Gr{\"o}bner basis makes the solution clear and easy
                  to explain.},

                  photogrammetric tasks. The standard procedure is to
                  apply an iterative adjustment to measurements of
                  known control points. The iterative adjustment needs
                  initial values of internal and external parameters.
                  In this paper we investigate a procedure where only
                  one parameter - the focal length is given a specific
                  initial value. The procedure is validated using the
                  freely available Damped Bundle Adjustment Toolbox on
                  five calibration data sets using varying narrow- and
                  wide-angle lenses. The results show that the

                  bundle adjustment methods implemented in the toolbox
                  converge even if the initial values of the focal

                  length, even if the parameters are highly

                  the toolbox enable manual selection of the lens
                  distortion parameters to estimate, something not

                  democratisation of UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles),
                  close range photogrammetry has seen more and more
                  use due to the easier capability to acquire aerial
                  close range images. In terms of photogrammetric
                  processing, many commercial software solutions exist
                  in the market that offer results from user-friendly
                  environments. However, in most commercial solutions,
                  a black-box approach to photogrammetric calculations
                  is often used. This is understandable in light of
                  the proprietary nature of the algorithms, but it may
                  pose a problem if the results need to be validated

                  adjustment can be split into a composition of simple
                  functions. According to the chain rule, the Jacobian
                  (linearisation) of the residual can be formed as a
                  product of the Jacobians of the individual steps.
                  When implemented, this enables a modularisation of
                  the computation of the bundle adjustment residuals
                  and Jacobians where each component has limited
                  responsibility. This enables simple replacement of

                  of Brown (1971) lens distortion model. In this
                  paper, we applied the technique to investigate how
                  affine distortions can be used to model the
                  projection of a tilt-shift lens. Two extended
                  distortion models were implemented to test the
                  hypothesis that the ordering of the affine and lens
                  distortion steps can be changed to reduce the size
                  of the residuals of a tilt-shift lens calibration.
                  Results on synthetic data confirm that the ordering
                  of the affine and lens distortion steps matter and
                  is detectable by DBAT. However, when applied to a
                  real camera calibration data set of a tilt-shift
                  lens, no difference between the extended models was
                  seen. This suggests that the tested hypothesis is
                  false and that other effects need to be modelled to
                  better explain the projection. The relatively low
                  implementation effort that was needed to generate
                  the models suggest that the technique can be used to
                  investigate other novel projection models in
                  photogrammetry, including modelling changes in the
                  3D geometry to better understand the tilt-shift
                  lens.},
